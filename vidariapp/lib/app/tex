Sure! Here's a **clear and concise explanation** of the core Flutter and Dart concepts, perfect for interviews, job tests, or revision:

## 🌀 **Flutter Lifecycle**

Flutter widgets go through a lifecycle, especially **stateful widgets**. Key lifecycle methods include:

| Method              | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initState()`       | Called once when the widget is inserted in the widget tree. Do setup here.      |
| `build()`           | Called every time the widget needs to be redrawn (UI rendering).                |
| `didUpdateWidget()` | Called when the widget is rebuilt with new configuration.                       |
| `dispose()`         | Called when the widget is removed. Clean up resources here (e.g., controllers). |

> 💡 For **stateless widgets**, only `build()` is used.

## 🌳 **Widget Tree & Rendering**

* Flutter uses a **widget tree** to describe the UI.
* Every visual element is a widget (Text, Column, Scaffold, etc.).
* Widgets are **immutable**, so Flutter rebuilds them when needed.

### Rendering Process:

1. **Build**: The framework creates a widget tree.
2. **Layout**: Measures size and position of each widget.
3. **Paint**: Draws the widgets to the screen.
4. **Composite**: Combines into one layer for display.

> 🧠 Flutter uses a diffing algorithm to only rebuild parts that changed — very efficient!

## ⏳ **Async Programming (Future, async/await)**

### `Future<T>`:

Represents a **value that will be available in the future**, like a network request.

```dart
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  return 'Data Loaded';
}
```

### `async` and `await`:

Used to write asynchronous code that **looks like synchronous code**.

```dart
void load() async {
  String data = await fetchData();
  print(data);
}
```

> 🔥 Avoids blocking the UI thread — improves performance and user experience.

## 🔤 **Dart Language Basics**

### Variables

```dart
int age = 25;
String name = "John";
bool isActive = true;
var score = 95; // Type inferred
```

### Functions

```dart
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Classes & Objects

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  Person(this.name, this.age);

  void greet() => print("Hi, I'm $name");
}
```

### Control Flow

```dart
if (age > 18) {
  print("Adult");
} else {
  print("Minor");
}

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

### Null Safety

```dart
String? maybeNull;       // Can be null
String notNull = "Hi";   // Cannot be null
```
